# Token Contract

This is a basic ERC20-like token contract implemented in Solidity. The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens, and any user can transfer and burn tokens. It also includes functions to check the balance of any address and the total supply of tokens.

## Overview

The `Token` contract provides the following functionalities:

- Minting tokens (only by the owner)
- Transferring tokens between addresses
- Burning tokens
- Querying the balance of an address
- Querying the total supply of tokens
